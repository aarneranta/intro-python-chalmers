# intro-python-chalmers

Code examples for Python Introduction courses at Chalmers University
of Technology.

There are several ways to obtain the code.
The best and the most sustainable one is first to **clone** it and
then to **pull** from regularly.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/aarneranta/intro-python-chalmers.git
$ cd intro-python-chalmers/
$ git pull 
```
This requires you to install the **git** program, unless you already
have it.

The second best method is to download the code as a zip file
regularly.
Click at the green "Code" button and scroll down to this alternative.

The third way is simply to navigare the GitHub page and click at the
individual files.
